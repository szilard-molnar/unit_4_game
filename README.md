Once the player presses "Start", the game begins. Each crystal will have different values, but it is the player's job to keep track of those values. Below the crystals there will be the value that needs to be reached by clicking on the crystals and adding up their values. If the player exeeds the target value, the game ends and he loses.

If the player can figure out the logic and can remember the values, and reached the required values, then he wins. 

The counter on the bottom if this section will keep track of wins and loses.

Hope you will enjoy it!!!
